The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The challenge came from the Frontend Mentor, with all the assets and instructions.

I thought it was a cool challenge. I was able to fix my knowledge in Sass, and practice a little more responsive web design with JavaScript DOM.
